Lie them flat in a single layer – use two trays rather than overcrowd one.

Cheesy Garlic Bread,Mozzarella#250&Butter#100&Garlic#40&Parsley#50&Baguette#250,Medium,1. Light the barbecue. Chop the mozzarella and taleggio into small chunks and tip into a bowl with the butter garlic herbs and some salt and pepper. If you want you can mix everything together with a wooden spoon but I prefer to use my hands. 2. Using a bread knife cut diagonal slices along the loaf about three quarters of the way into the bread – don’t cut all the way through. If it looks like the bread won’t fit on the barbecue cut it in half and make two smaller ones. 3. Push the garlic butter generously between each cut allowing some to ooze onto the top – it will caramelise and taste superb. Sprinkle the paprika over. Wrap the bread up like a cracker in a double thickness of foil. You can prepare to this stage up to a day ahead. 4. Put the pack straight onto the barbecue. Cook for 2 minutes then roll it over onto its side and cook for 2 minutes more. Roll it onto its other side and cook for a further 2 minutes. Have a peek – if the cheese is melting and the bread is crispy remove it from the barbie. Pull the slices apart and eat while hot and gooey.
